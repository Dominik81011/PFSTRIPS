**Hello guys I built a PF-Strip (Flight Progress Strip) system for controller I would like to get a feedback to have some new ideas there is a Clearence Systeme for Delivery Controller in WIP (Like euroscope) the Strip Overlay is kinda bad and in  progress this is just a early beta if you have questions please text me / @ me or send me messages via DM 😊 **

**Informations About the system **

- Charts System with an Zoom function (click on the picture)

- Position System with informations about the Frequenz and the Positioning if the selected airport 

- Squawk Genarator with the Atisgenarator Design 

- Big WIP incoming at the top-right  realease date 📅  15/12/24  ~~Atisgenarator~~? ~~clearence~~?  ~~Multiplayer~~?

**The big Strip System **

- Create Strip You can create tons of strips via clicking the Button

- Delete Strip you can delete your newest  Strip via clicking the button 

- How can  I configure my Strip? = Just double click of a Text and Type your text in 

Like C/S = Callsign + Doubleclick + BAW1233 

- How can I switch from DEL to GND? = Just drag and drop your Strip to the section 


**That's all what I want to say I hope some members are gone use this plugin/tool there is also a multi-player coming so be patient 🙏 😊**
